# Online-Retailing
This project mocks the online shopping platforms by providing a simple user interface to the user who can then purchase various products &amp; view the features of each product. The program then generates a final bill based on what the user has purchased.


The objective of this project is to develop a general-purpose e-commerce store where products like novels, makeup products, mobile phones can be bought from the comfort of home. The development of this console-based application was carried out on the Eclipse IDE using the Java programming language. It is an interface for customers to browse a catalogue and order various products online. The selected items are collected in a shopping cart. 

At checkout time, the items in the shopping cart will be presented as an order. At that time, more information will be needed to complete the transaction. The customer will be asked to fill basic information, shipping address, and payment information such as credit card number, thereby confirming the order.
